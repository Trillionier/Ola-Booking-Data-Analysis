OLA Data Analysis
In this project, I analyzed Ola booking data using Power BI to uncover key insights and trends. The primary objective was to create an interactive and visually engaging dashboard that effectively summarizes the key performance indicators (KPIs) for better decision-making.
Outcome:
The project demonstrated the power of combining data analytics with interactive visuals to derive actionable insights. The use of the car image filter added a unique and engaging touch, enabling stakeholders to explore the data seamlessly and make informed business decisions.

This dashboard serves as a comprehensive tool for Ola's operational and strategic planning.
